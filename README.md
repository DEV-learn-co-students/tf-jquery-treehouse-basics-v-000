# Learn jQuery

#### The following work is **REQUIRED** for teachers teaching FE I or II, and is **OPTIONAL** for teachers teaching SE I or II.

jQuery is among the most powerful and widely used javascript libraries, and is central to our front-end courses. Work through Team Treehouse's [jQuery Basics](http://teamtreehouse.com/library/jquery-basics) course to get up to speed.

CodeSchool's [Try jQuery](http://try.jquery.com/) is also a lot of fun, if you have time for it.
